        <h3 id="Movie1">Doctor Strange</h3>
        <ul>

            <!-- source of movie summary www.imdb.com -->
            <p align="justify">On top of his game, the brilliant but arrogant New York City neurosurgeon with the magic hands, Dr Stephen Strange, is more interested in fame and his perfect success rate than saving lives. Then, humbled by a nearly fatal car accident, and with both his impeccable career and his gifted hands mangled beyond repair, Strange heads to Kamar-Taj, a mystical place of healing in Kathmandu, begging the Ancient One, the Sorcerer Supreme and leader of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, for salvation and enlightenment. However, war is brewing over, as the corrupt, power-obsessed former disciple, Kaecilius, and his Zealots, are bent on unlocking an unfathomable parallel dimension, and usher in a new dark era on Earth. Now, the world is on the verge of destruction. Can Doctor Strange harness his extraordinary newfound abilities, and accept his destiny?</p>
            <!-- My own personal opinion why this movie is my favorite -->
            <p align="justify">The reason why I like the the movie because of the story of this film takes a standard sob story and transforms it into something I've never seen before (In my own personal opinion). It depicts difficulty from the perspective of a Dr. Stephen Strange who has never known struggle before plunging him into a convoluted adventure about a hidden magic-driven religion, leaving him convinced that his future lies in that Tibetan temple. Another reason why I like the movie is because of the special effects Marvel created a superhero genesis that felt more spiritually enlightening than anything else. The magic appears to be very beautiful, but it also appears genuine, almost plausible. The visual effects are psychedelic in nature, giving the audience a sensation of absolute immersion in the picture. Dr. Strange basically took everything good about Inception and multiplied it by five. The viewer is strapped in from the first scene and kept on the edge of their seats until the post-credit scenes.</p>

        <!-- my second favorite movie-->
        <h3 id="Movie2">Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</h3>
        <ul>

        <!-- source of movie summary www.imdb.com -->
            <p align="justify">With his beloved grandfather's riveting stories about the exceptionally gifted children known as the "Peculiars", the ordinary Joe teenage, Jake, sets out on a journey with his father to find the mysterious Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children; a haven for all those born with unusual and extraordinary abilities. Persecuted through the ages, the Peculiars live protected from the outside world under their Headmistress' wing inside an enchanted and well-hidden orphanage that seems to defy the laws of time, perpetually looping the same day, every day. However, when out-of-place Jake begins to realise that, in a way, he fits in Miss Peregrine's sanctuary, his grandfather's bedtime fables about dangerous and terrifying creatures, the bizarre, and the Peculiars, will start to take shape. Could the dark and utterly ominous stories be plausible?</p>
        <!-- My own personal opinion why this movie is my favorite -->
            <p align="justify">"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children," directed by Tim Burton, is one of my favorite films, and I thought it interesting. Though they said that he made numerous significant and little alterations to the film, I still admire his dedication and hard work in the production of the film.Some children may be terrified to witness this, while others may be completely unfazed. Individual temperaments will play a big role. This may be appropriate for children as young as ten, however many people may find it unpleasant due to the realism of the "bad" monsters and people. All of the performers and actresses, especially Asa Butterfield, Ella Purnell, and Eva Green, did an outstanding job.</p>

            <p align="justify">For me this movie defies a simple explanation. But my summary line above should give you a clue. And still, there are so many things that will surprise you because they are coming from so far left field. If your into Anime like me. It will not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you indulge and indulge the craziness that unfolds and this is wholesome.</p>

        <!-- My own personal opinion why this movie is my favorite -->
            <p align="justify">This is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched . I like how the movie depicts diverse perspectives on life, death, love, and friendship between Hazel and Gus. I believe the actors were excellent in their parts and performed an excellent job. I can't stop reading quotes from this book because I never grow tired of them. This is a great movie in my opinion because it is more about Gus and Hazel's relationship and how they managed to keep going for each other and didn't leave each other's side till they were separated by fate, leaving viewers with a good message, and it is overall a this is why it is one of my favorite beautiful movie.</p>

        <h3 id="Movie5">Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</h3>

        <!-- My own personal opinion why this movie is my favorite -->
            <p align="justify">Amazing and incredible If I had to pick a favorite from the original three Star Wars films, it would be this one, with its fantastic mystery, melodic score, characters, dramatic fights, breathtaking effects, wonderful locations, and everything else this masterpiece has to offer. While Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan McGregor, and Hayden Christensen continue to do an outstanding job in their roles as Master Windu, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker(Darth Vader), all of the other performers were as impressive. This film is intriguing because it shows how one of the most iconic Disney villains, Darth Vader, came to be, and if you ask me, seeing how Darth Vader came to be is both fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time, but it's also fascinating because it shows how Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia came to be.</p>
