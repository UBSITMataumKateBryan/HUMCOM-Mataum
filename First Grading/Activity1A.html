            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p align="justify">Egg fried rice is one of the simplest stir-fries around, but it's the details of the process that elevate its basic ingredients into something transcendental. This guide will cut out everything extraneous and show you how to get the most out of your eggs and rice, no matter your stirring-fry gear situation. If you happen to have some leftover rice in the refrigerator, egg fried rice is one of my no-brainer dishes to fix in the kitchen! Egg fried rice is a fast and affordable dish that I can whip up on any given day. The best part is it goes well with any other dishes/sauces you decided to pair with!</p>
            <p align="justify"> It's simple and quick to make egg fried rice at home. It only takes 5 minutes or less. The ingredients are as straightforward as this: </p>
            <ul><!--default unordered list type-->
                <li>Cooking oil</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Cold rice</li>
                <li>MSG</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>Green Onions</li>
                <li>Optional</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="justify">If you add more vegetables or protein, it becomes a complete meal. The possibilities are endless: chicken, shrimp, crab, steak, pig, and more! You may serve this simple egg fried rice as a side dish with teriyaki chicken, sticky Chinese ribs, beef and broccoli, creamy shrimp, and other dishes. More possibilities can be found in my entree recipes. If you want a kick, add additional sriracha, or more soy sauce if you want it to be more savory.</p>
