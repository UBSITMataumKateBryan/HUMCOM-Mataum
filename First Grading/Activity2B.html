This guide will cut out everything extraneous and show you how to get the most out of your eggs and rice, no matter your stirring-fry gear situation. If you happen to have some leftover rice in the refrigerator, egg fried rice is one of my no-brainer dishes to fix in the kitchen! Egg fried rice is a fast and affordable dish that I can whip up on any given day. The best part is it goes well with any other dishes/sauces you decided to pair with!</p>
            <p align="justify"> It's simple and quick to make egg fried rice at home. It only takes 5 minutes or less. The ingredients are as straightforward as this: </p>

            <p align="justify">If you add more vegetables or protein, it becomes a complete meal. The possibilities are endless: chicken, shrimp, crab, steak, pig, and more! You may serve this simple egg fried rice as a side dish with teriyaki chicken, sticky Chinese ribs, beef and broccoli, creamy shrimp, and other dishes. More possibilities can be found in my entree recipes. If you want a kick, add additional sriracha, or more soy sauce if you want it to be more savory.</p>
